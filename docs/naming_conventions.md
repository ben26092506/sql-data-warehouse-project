# Naming Conventions

## General Principles

- **Naming Conventions:** Use `snake_case`, with lowercase letters and underscores (`_`) to separate words.
- **Language:** Use English for all names.
- **Avoid Reserved Words:** Do not use SQL reserved words as object names.

## Table Naming Conventions

### Bronze Rules

- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- Naming pattern:

```text
<sourcesystem>_<entity>
```

- `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system, for example `crm`, `erp`.
- `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.
- Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### Silver Rules

- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- Naming pattern:

```text
<sourcesystem>_<entity>
```

- `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system, for example `crm`, `erp`.
- `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.
- Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### Gold Rules

- All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
- Naming pattern:

```text
<category>_<entity>
```

- `<category>`: Describes the role of the table, such as `dim` for dimension table or `fact` for fact table.
- `<entity>`: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain, for example `customers`, `products`, `sales`.
- Examples:
  - `dim_customers` → Dimension table for customer data.
  - `fact_sales` → Fact table containing sales transactions.

### Glossary of Category Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Example(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `dim_` | Dimension table | `dim_customer`, `dim_product` |
| `fact_` | Fact table | `fact_sales` |
| `agg_` | Aggregated table | `agg_customers`, `agg_sales_monthly` |

## Column Naming Conventions

### Surrogate Keys

- All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix `_key`.
- Naming pattern:

```text
<table_name>_key
```

- `<table_name>`: Refers to the name of the table or entity the key belongs to.
- `_key`: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.
- Example: `customer_key` → Surrogate key in the `dim_customers` table.

### Technical Columns

- All technical columns must start with the prefix `dwh_`, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column’s purpose.
- Naming pattern:

```text
dwh_<column_name>
```

- `dwh`: Prefix exclusively for system-generated metadata.
- `<column_name>`: Descriptive name indicating the column’s purpose.
- Example: `dwh_load_date` → System-generated column used to store the date when the record was loaded.

## Stored Procedure

- All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern:

```text
load_<layer>
```

- `<layer>`: Represents the layer being loaded, such as `bronze`, `silver`, or `gold`.
- Examples:
  - `load_bronze` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze layer.
  - `load_silver` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Silver layer.
